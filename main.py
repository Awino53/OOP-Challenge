# This code is a simple simulation of a pet's behavior. It allows you to create a pet, check its status, feed it, play with it, let it sleep, train it to do tricks, and show the tricks it has learned. The pet's hunger, energy, and happiness levels are managed through various methods. The code demonstrates basic object-oriented programming principles in Python.
# The Pet class has methods to manage the pet's state and behavior, and the main script creates an instance of the Pet class and interacts with it.
